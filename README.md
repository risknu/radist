## Radist - Safely Save Messages and Memorable Moments
We've all experienced times when we wanted to save a moment from a game or chat but didn't have the means to do so, whether due to lack of space or other reasons. This project is here to help. With a simple command `...`, you can easily and quickly save any image or text you want, all for free, without losing quality, and always within reach.

## Getting Started
I assume everyone knows how to download a repository, navigate into it, and so on. Ideally, you will need Python 3.11, and to install everything and run the project, follow these steps:
```bash
# Install dependencies (python-dotenv, disnake, ruff)
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
# Run the main script
$ python run.py
```
